# **New Scenario & Use Case**

### **Scenario:**

The education sector is shifting from traditional teaching to tech-enhanced learning using AI-powered tutoring platforms.

### **Use Case:**

AI-based virtual learning assistants are used for personalized learning, automated assessments, and real-time student progress tracking.

### **Target Audience:**

Schools, universities, online learning platforms.

### **Objectives:**

* Boost student learning outcomes by 40%
* Reduce manual workload for teachers
* Provide personalized study plans
* Enable real-time analytics for performance tracking

---

# **PROCEDURE**

---

## **1. Comparative Analysis Prompt**

### **Prompt:**

*"Compare and contrast AI-powered learning assistants with traditional classroom teaching methods."*

### **ChatGPT:**

AI learning assistants offer personalized lessons, instant doubt-clearing, and progress analytics. Traditional teaching depends heavily on the teacher’s pace and attention span. AI reduces workload while traditional methods bring emotional connection and live interaction.

### **Gemini:**

AI tutoring is faster and personalized, while classroom teaching gives human support and face-to-face clarity. AI helps track each student individually; traditional methods work better for group learning.

---

## **2. Experiential Perspective Prompt**

### **Prompt:**

*"As a school principal, explain how AI-based personalized learning has improved student performance."*

### **ChatGPT:**

As a principal, AI personalized learning helps my students learn at their own pace. Struggling students get extra guidance, and fast learners move ahead without delays. Teachers get quick reports, making it easier to target weak areas and boost overall academic growth.

### **Gemini:**

From my point of view as a principal, AI personalization makes learning smoother. Students get tailored help, teachers save time, and overall results have improved because feedback is instant.

---

## **3. Everyday Functioning Prompt**

### **Prompt:**

*"Describe how AI tools help in daily school operations such as attendance, assignments, and assessments."*

### **ChatGPT:**

AI automates attendance tracking, evaluates assignments instantly, and generates smart assessments based on each student’s progress. Teachers can monitor performance dashboards daily and adjust lessons dynamically.

### **Gemini:**

AI takes care of routine tasks like marking attendance, checking answers, and preparing small quizzes. It makes everyday school work easier and faster for teachers.

---

## **4. Universal Prompt Structures / Prompt Refinements**

### **Prompt:**

*"Explain adaptive learning in simple terms with an example."*

### **ChatGPT:**

Adaptive learning means the system adjusts lessons based on how well a student is doing. For example, if a student struggles in fractions, the AI gives easier problems first and slowly increases difficulty as they improve.

### **Gemini:**

Adaptive learning changes lessons depending on the student’s level. For instance, if someone is weak in grammar, the system gives more basic exercises until they get better.

---

## **5. Prompt Size Limitations**

### **Prompt:**

*"List 20 benefits of AI in education."*
(Broken into smaller chunks: *"List 5 benefits of AI in education."*)

### **ChatGPT:**

1. Personalized lessons
2. Automated grading
3. Better time management for teachers
4. Interactive learning
5. Real-time analytics

### **Gemini:**

1. Quick evaluations
2. Personalized support
3. Smart content suggestions
4. Progress tracking
5. Reduced teacher workload
